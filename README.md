# Canal-Resort-Reservation-App
Canal Resort has asked for a "prototype" reservation form to be created.  (It is a prototype in that it will likely be a web app, but for now they want to see it as a desktop one.)  They are going to let you figure out placement of the controls on the form, and you want to do this well so that you get the eventual "build our site" contract.
